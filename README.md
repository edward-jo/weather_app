# Weather app

This app shows current date and weather of specific city. The app gets `date info` from http://worldclockapi.com/api/json/utc/now, and `weather info` from https://openweathermap.org/ using `weather` flutter package.

## Getting Started

1. Create an API key to access OpenWeatherMap.com.
2. Create `.env` file in root directory of the project.
3. Add `WEATHER_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"` into `.env` file like below.

```bash
WEATHER_API_KEY="0025849d2a15d7c9a068915854bbdcb1"
```
